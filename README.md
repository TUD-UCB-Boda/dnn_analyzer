# DNN analyzer

Deep neural networks often consume a lot of computating power and memory, making them quite challenging to be deployed on edge devices.
In this project, we aim to develop a **lightweight neural network analyzer based on PyTorch** to predict the computational requirements of a DNN.

We have studied many different existing neural network analyzer to understand and benefit from their approaches.

Thanks to @Swall0w and @sovrasov who already implemented and published neural network analyzers.
